A git branch is used for developing something separately from the master branch or the current version of a program (that presumably works and a developer is happy to make it available to others). Branches can be beneficial for teams with members developing different parts and features of the same program simultaneously, without affecting the master copy of the program. When a version of the program is finished being developed, it can then be merged with the master branch. and branches that a team or developer decide to scrap would simply not be merged with the master branch.
